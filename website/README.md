# BIT Web UI

This is the framework's user interface, which allows users to interact with the system in order to see its status, as well as look up reports from the different bit-clients.

The web app was created using `create-react-app` and is written in Typescript & React.
The base components were built using Material-UI and Axios was used for API calls to the server.

## Installation
In order to run the app you'll need `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.
First run `npm install` and then to start the app use `npm start` as usual.
